# About this Project (CPE 133)
This was a final project from my Digital Design class that used SystemVerilog as the main program. This project is a memory game built on the Basys 3 FPGA. In each round, the board lights up 8 out of 16 LEDs in a random pattern. The player watches the pattern, then tries to match it using the switches. If the input is correct, they move to the next level; if not, the game ends. The game uses a state machine to control the flow, a random pattern generator, and a level tracker. A seven-segment display shows the current level or messages like PASS or FAIL, depending on how the player does. All inputs (like buttons and switches) and outputs (LEDs and display) are handled cleanly through a modular design.
